# FitKraft Website Design Changes

## Overview
Based on the client requirements, we've implemented a minimalist website design with yellow accents on a cream background, grid-based layout, reduced text with more visuals, and clean sans-serif typography.

## Color Scheme
- **Background**: Cream (#FDF7ED) - A warm, inviting off-white that's easier on the eyes than pure white
- **Accent**: Bold Yellow (#F1E05A) - Used for buttons, highlights, and important elements
- **Text**: Dark gray (#1A1A1A) - For optimal legibility on the cream background
- **Secondary**: Light cream for cards and sections

## Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter and Poppins (clean sans-serif fonts)
- **Text Reduction**: Shortened content throughout the site, focusing on key messages
- **Font Sizes**: Adjusted for better hierarchy and readability
- **Line Height**: Optimized for comfortable reading
